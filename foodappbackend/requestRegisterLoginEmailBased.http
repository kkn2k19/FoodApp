# it worked 
# now theres a problem in our otp system 
# suppose a user continuously tries to resend otp and it will fill our DB after some time 
#  so we need to fix a time gap between otp resend option in the resend method
#  so from now onwards everytime a otp is created it will be given a createdAt time stamp to track it 
# so we need to modify the current Email model and add a field createdAt which will store LocalDateTime.now()

# lets try resending within time gap
